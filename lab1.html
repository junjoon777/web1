<h2 id="b">Why is it my favorite team?</h2>

<p>Throughout my life, I was not really into watching sports until my junior year of highschool. During my junior year, I started watching Engish Premier League and National Football League with my friends. My younger brother and my friends were really into professional soccer leagues, so I was influenced by them. The most popular soccer league in the world is English Premier League and I had to choose a team to support. I was immediately attracted to Liverpool FC due to its playing style: fast and aggresive attack play rather than being defensive. I also liked the fact that Liverpool FC is strong against big clubs and weak against small clubs. During my Senior year, Liverpool miraculary went to the Final of European Champions League, which is the most prestigious tournament in the world. Although Liverpool didn't get the first place, it was enough for me to decide that I will support this team until I die. </p>
